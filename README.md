Hi, welcome to Singapore!

This is a handbook for #rubyfriends from overseas
put together by members of the Singapore Ruby community.

## Meetups

RubySG meetups are held once a month, on a Tuesday.

For updates on the latest meetup, please check us out on Meetup.com.

## Data SIM Card

You can go into most convenience stores (eg. 7-11) and buy a pre-paid simcard
from either SingTel or StarHub (or possibly M1).

[SingTel plans](http://info.singtel.com/personal/phones-plans/mobile/singtel-prepaid)
and
[StarHub plans](http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/prepaid-plans.html).

You are very unlikely to find a nano format simcard however, which means you
should look for a phone store.

Looks like [this is the card](https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10152525153311677)
to get for those who need nano sims.

## Power (Socket)

This [bad boy](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm) (Type G, BS 1363 UK, 230-240V).

Sometimes you can force the two prong [European Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm)
into the socket, but it involves shoving a metal fork into the third hole, so I
tend to avoid using this one.

## Free WiFi

Changi Airport has it.

[Comment: Changi Airport is *amazing*. I returned from a trip one day and to
get from the gate, through customers and into a taxi took FOUR minutes.]

And the reboutable ladyironchef [lays down](http://www.ladyironchef.com/2013/08/cafes-free-wifi-singapore/)
where the free wifi cafes are.

## Tipping

No real need to tip. Leave a few coins if you'd like (to get rid of your coins).

You don't need to tip at a hawker foodstall, and normal restaurants include a
10% service charge.

[Comment: Oh and talking about coins, Singapore is in a transition from one set
of coins to another differently sized set. So you'll get two sizes of each
coin. Yay!]

## Tissue Culture

Singaporeans often leave tissues on seats in busy food halls (hawker centres
etc.) while they walk around and buy food. I know you'll be tempted but best
not to remove the tissue and sit down.

[Comment: If you need your own tissues, hawker centres are the place to buy
them. You'll often find an older gentleman or lady offering one, two or more
packets for a dollar or two.]

## Communication

English mainly.
[Singlish](http://www.aussiepete.com/2008/05/singlish-language-guide-for-foreigners.html).

[Comment: You'll look like an idiot if you try this slang. I try to get away
with answering "are you able to?" questions with "can!", but mostly that just
makes me look like an idiot. YMMV.]

## What to buy to bring back home

- Bak Kwa
- Pandan Cake or Kueh Lapis from Bengawan Solo  
  Conveniently they have [outlets at Changi Airport](http://www.changiairport.com/shopping-and-dining/shopping/bengawan-solo).
- Pineapple cakes from [Sunny Hills](http://www.sunnyhills.com.sg/stores.php)

## Don'ts

- vandalism
- littering
- chewing gum  
  [Comment: Actually you can chew gum like a cow chews cud, but you won't be
  able to buy any gum in Singapore and when you need to get rid of your gum,
  make sure you put it in a bin - see "littering" above.]

## Getting Around

Public transport in Singapore is excellent (see below) and probably should be
your first choice.

If you're in the central area you can certainly get to many places by walking
(but of course it's always hot and humid - and sometimes raining heavily - so
please take this into account).

### Taxi

- GrabTaxi
- Uber

Taxis could be a challenge during raining days.

### MRT and Buses

There are the [MRT trains](http://www.smrt.com.sg/Trains/NetworkMap.aspx) which
are frequent, clean and fast (and *full* of people during rush hour). (They run
underground in the central part of Singapore.)

There are the [buses](http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/) which go everywhere, and
are also very clean and comfortable.

Changi Airport has a MRT station at Terminal 2 and it takes about 45 min to get
into town. You take the train past expo which ends at Tanah Merah, then you
wait for a green line train *from* Pasir Ris *towards* Joo Koon. This then
takes you into the central area (probably City Hall or Raffles Place - don't go
all the way to Joo Koon!).
