Hi, welcome to Singapore!

This is a handbook for #rubyfriends from overseas
put together by members of the Singapore Ruby community.

## Meetups

RubySG meetups are held once a month, on a Tuesday.

For updates on the latest meetup, please check us out on Meetup.com.

## Data SIM Card

You can go into most convenience stores (eg. 7-11) and buy a pre-paid simcard
from either SingTel or StarHub (or possibly M1).

[SingTel plans](http://info.singtel.com/personal/phones-plans/mobile/singtel-prepaid)
and
[StarHub plans](http://www.starhub.com/personal/mobile/prepaid-plans.html).

You are very unlikely to find a nano format simcard however, which means you
should look for a phone store.

Looks like [this is the card](https://www.facebook.com/singtel/posts/10152525153311677)
to get for those who need nano sims.

## Power (Socket)

This [bad boy](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeG.htm) (Type G, BS 1363 UK, 230-240V).

Sometimes you can force the two prong [European Type C](http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/typeC.htm)
into the socket, but it involves shoving a metal fork into the third hole, so I
tend to avoid using this one.

## Free WiFi

## Tipping

No real need to tip. Leave a few coins if you'd like (to get rid of your coins).

You wouldn't tip at a hawker foodstall, and normal restaurants include a 10%
service charge.

Oh and talking about coins, Singapore is in a transition from one set of coins
to another differently sized set. So you'll get two sizes of each coin. Yay!

## Tissue Culture

Singaporeans often leave tissues on seats in busy food halls (hawker centres
etc.) while they walk around and buy food. I know you'll be tempted but best
not to remove the tissue and sit down.

## Communication

English mainly. Singlish.

## What to buy to bring back home

- Bak Kwa
- Pandan Cake from Bengawan Solo

## Don'ts

- vandalism
- littering
- chewing gum  
  Actually you can chew gum like a cow chews cud, but you won't be able to buy
  any gum in Singapore and when you need to get rid of your gum, make sure you
  put it in a bin - see "littering" above.

## Getting Around

### Taxi

- GrabTaxi
- Uber

Taxis could be a challenge during raining days.

### MRT and Buses

- Google
- Singapore Changi Airport has a MRT station at Terminal 2 and it takes about
  45 min to get into town.

MRTs are crowded during peak hours.

But MRTs are frequent, safe and clean (as are the buses). Always a good option.
